# The Essex IQ Story

I founded Essex IQ in high school as a way to share my love of competitive robotics with students who didn't have the opportunities and resources necessary to experience it the way I did. Through collaboration with the Essex County Executive's office and the Essex County Schools of Technology, we were able to secure the funding necessary for the program and build a complete curriculum for our students. We began teaching virtually in 2020 with VR programming seminars, and our inaugural summer session was in 2021. In the summer of 2022, we expanded to a second location, and we're now able to provide more than 60 students each summer witht he opportunity to learn about robotics and compete in our unique "Essex IQ Culminating Competition."
