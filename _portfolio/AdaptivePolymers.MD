I currently work as a research assistant in Dr. Jennings' Lab at Vanderbilt. The focus of our work is on producing these "adaptive polymers" that respond to changes in environmental conditions. For example, a polymer consisting of carbon chains functionalized by carboxylic acids and benzene rings has both polar and nonpolar regions, each of which will physically shift toward the surface given the correct conditions. Additionally, changes in pH will protonate or deprotonate the carboxylic acid, which adds another layer of functionality to the system.
